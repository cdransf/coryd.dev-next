Hi! I'm Cory. 👋🏻

This is the code for my personal website and portfolio. Built using Next.js and deployed on Vercel. It was scaffolded out with and modified from [Timothy Lin](https://github.com/timlrx)'s [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project (which I highly recommend checking out).

I've modified the theme to match the look of my previous sites core color schemes and imagery and made a number of other changes (which I imagine will continue).

I make use of [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for analytics. You can opt out of that [here](https://coryd.dev/static/analytics.html).
