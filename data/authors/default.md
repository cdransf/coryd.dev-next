I'm a software developer in Camarillo, California. I enjoy hanging out with my beautiful family and 4 rescue dogs, technology, automation, <a href="https://last.fm/user/cdme_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music</a>, writing, <a href="https://oku.club/user/cory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading</a> and <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tv</a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/cdme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movies</a>.

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2010 with a focus on frontend technologies.

I tend to write about whatever strikes me, with a focus on development, technology, automation or issues I run into with these things. This is all typically light on editing with and heavy on spur of the moment thoughts.
