Hi! I'm Cory üëãüèª

I'm a software developer in Camarillo, California. I enjoy hanging out with my beautiful family and 4 rescue dogs, technology, automation, [music](https://www.last.fm/user/cdme_), writing, [reading](https://oku.club/user/cory) and [tv and movies](https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf).

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2010 with a focus on frontend technologies.

I tend to write about whatever strikes me, with a focus on development, technology, automation or issues I run into with these things. This is all typically light on editing with and heavy on spur of the moment thoughts.

Feel free to get in touch using the links below.
